HR Data Analytics Dashboard

A dynamic Power BI dashboard built to analyze and visualize HR metrics around diversity, attrition, leave balances, etc. Designed to improve HR reporting efficiency and offer insights that help with decision-making.

🧐 Why This Dashboard

Organizations gather a lot of HR data — on hires, exits, leaves, and demographics — but often lack a cohesive way to generate insights quickly. This dashboard helps in:

Tracking attrition trends over time

Measuring diversity (gender, etc.)

Monitoring leave balances and patterns

Providing percentage-based metrics to compare groups fairly

Enabling business leaders to spot issues (e.g. high turnover, imbalanced representation) early

🔍 What’s Inside / Key Metrics

Attrition Rate — How many employees are leaving compared to total staff, tracked over time

Diversity Metrics — Gender distribution, possibly other demographic breakdowns

Leave Balance & Usage — Number of leave days taken vs remaining; leave usage patterns

Percentage-based comparisons — e.g. comparing leave or attrition by gender / department etc., not just raw counts

Trend analyses to see whether metrics are improving or worsening over time

📈 Outcome / Impact

Reporting efficiency improved (time saved in creating reports)

Better visibility into HR issues (turnover hotspots, imbalance in representation etc.)

HR leaders / stakeholders can make more data-driven decisions

🚧 Future Enhancements

Here are some ideas you might consider adding:

Additional demographic breakdowns (age, tenure, location, etc.)

Forecasting or predictive analytics for attrition/leaves

Integration with live HR systems or automated data refreshes

More interactivity: drill-downs by team, manager, etc.

Benchmarking against industry standards
